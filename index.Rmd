The Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R ('fasstr') is a set of [R](http://www.r-project.org) functions to clean, summarize, analyze, trend, and visualize streamflow data. This package summarizes continuous daily mean streamflow data into various daily, monthly, annual, and long-term statistics, completes annual trends and frequency analyses, in both table and plot formats.

This package provides functions with solutions for streamflow data:

- cleaning (to prepare data for analyses; `add_*` and `fill_*` functions),
- screening (to look for outliers and missing data; `screen_*` functions),
- analyzing (basic summary statistics, frequency analyses, trending ;`calc_*` and `compute_*` functions), and 
- visualizing (to plot statistics; `plot_*` functions), amongst others.

Useful features of functions include:

- the integration of the 'tidyhydat' package to pull streamflow data from a Water Survey of Canada [HYDAT](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html) database for analyses;
- arguments for filtering of years and months in analyses and plotting (internally tidys your data);
- choosing the start month of your water year;
- selecting for rolling day averages (e.g. 7-day rolling average);
- plotting options; and,
- choosing how missing dates are handled, amongst others.

## Installation

You can install 'fasstr' using the following code. It may take a few moments as there are several dependency packages will also be installed, including ['tidyhydat'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyhydat) for downloading Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data, ['zyp'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zyp) for trending, ['ggplot2'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) for creating plots, and ['dplyr'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) and ['tidyr'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr) for various data wrangling and summarizing functions, amongst others. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fasstr")
```

To install the development version of the 'fasstr' package, you need to install the remotes package then the 'fasstr' package.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/fasstr")
```

To utilize the 'tidyhydat' features (using the station_number argument), you will need to download a HYDAT database using the `tidyhydat::download_hydat()` function.
